  "Last free cell is the basic Sudoku solving technique. It's pretty simple and based on the fact that each 3×3 block, vertical column or horizontal row on Sudoku grid should contain numbers from 1 to 9 and each number can be used only once within 3×3 block, vertical column or horizontal row. Therefore, if we see that there is only one free cell left in the 3×3 block, vertical column or horizontal row, then we have to define which number from 1 to 9 is missing and enter it in this empty cell. You can see how it looks in the examples below. This is the main basic rule.

  "Last remaining cell is another basic Sudoku strategy. It's based on the fact that numbers should not be repeated within 3×3 block, vertical column and horizontal row. Let's take a look at an example with the 3x3 block. There always must be number 8 - in each block, column and row. There's already 8 in the column and in the row. As we already know, we can't repeat numbers. So we can't place 8 there again. It means that there's only one cell remaining inside the block and we should put number 8 into it.

  "Last possible number is a simple strategy that is suitable for beginners. It is based on finding the missing number. To find the missing number you should take a look at the numbers that are already exist in the 3x3 block you are interested in, and in the rows and columns connected with it. Let's take a look at an example. Pay attention to the highlighted cell. Look at the numbers in its block, row and column. We can see that numbers 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 are already used in this row, column and block. The only missing number is 5. Considering that numbers should not be repeated, the only number that must be put in this cell is 5. That is how Last possible number technique works.

  "Obvious singles technique": "Obvious singles technique",
  "This strategy is based on the correct placement of Notes. Sometimes it is called Naked Singles. The point is that in a specific cell only one digit (from the Notes) remains possible. Let's have look at this case with an example. Let's look at the highlited cell. We can see that it is filled with only one Note - number 2. It means that this cell has only one possible solution. Since it is the only possible option, this cell will be 2. So we remove Note from this cell and fill it with the number 2. That is how Obvious singles technique works.

  "Obvious pairs technique": "Obvious pairs technique",
  "Like the Obvious Singles technique, Obvious pairs is based on the correct placement of Notes. The point is that you should find 2 cells with the same pairs of Notes within 3x3 block. This means that these pairs of Notes cannot be used in other cells within this 3x3 block. So they can be removed from your Notes. It will be easier to understand this strategy if you look at the example. Let's look at this block. We see empty cells filled with notes of possible numbers. Among them, there are two cells that contain 7 or 9. This means that one of these cells necessarily contains 7 and the other one contains 9. This also means that we can't have 7 and 9 in other cells of this block. Hence, we remove them from other cells' notes. Next we can apply the Obvious singles rule we learned in the previous lesson. We'll write 6 in the cell with a single note of 6 and and 4 in another one. That is how Obvious Pairs technique can be used while solving Sudoku.

  "This Sudoku solving technique is built upon the previous one - Obvious pairs. But Obvious triples is not based on two numbers from the Notes, it's based on three. This is the only difference. To understand better, let's take a look at the example. Look at the top left block. Its three bottom cells contain notes of 1, 5; 1, 8 & 5, 8. This means that these cells have number 1, 5 & 8 in them but we don't know yet where each number is exactly. What we know though, is that 1, 5 & 8 can't be in other cells of this block.

  "Hidden singles technique": "Hidden singles technique",
  "Hidden singles is a quite simple Sudoku technique. The point of Hidden singles is that a Note is the only one of its kind in an entire row, column, or 3x3 block. However, this technique requires careful attention from the player, because it can be quite hard to spot the single Notes. It will be easier to understand this technique if you look at the example. Let's pay attention to this 3x3 block with Notes. There is only one cell, that may contain number 1. It's the top right cell. There are no any other cells in this block whith the Note 1.

  "Hidden pairs technique works the same way as Hidden singles. The only thing that changes is the number of cells and Notes. If you can find two cells within a row, column, or 3x3 block where two Notes appear nowhere outside these cells, these two Notes must be placed in the two cells. All other Notes can be eliminated from these two cells. For example: Let's pay attention to this block with Notes and look for the numbers that can be found in Notes less often than others. Only two cells contain 2 and 6. This means 2 must occupy one of these cells and 6 must occupy another. Any other numbers cannot be found in these cells.

  "Hidden triples technique is very similar to Hidden pairs and works on the same concept. Hidden triples applies when three cells in a row, column, or 3x3 block contain the same three Notes.

To understand Pointing pairs better, let's take a look at the example. Let's look at the block at the top left corner. All the cells that might contain number 4 are located in one column.
